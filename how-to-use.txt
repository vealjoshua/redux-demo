How to use the downloaded files

1) Run "npm install" in the extracted folder
2) Run "npm start" to view the project

Compare my code to yours to solve issues you might encounter. You may also copy the content of src/ into your own project's src/ folder to use your project setup (which might've been created with a different create-react-app version) and still use my code.

1. Setting Up the Reducer and Store

    Show users the stand-alone function of redux by create a node.js file containing a store and reducer and output the state.

// Initial State
// Reducer
// Store
// Subscription
// Dispatching Action

2. Dispacting Actions

    Create 2 store.dispatch to show users how to dispatch an action. Create action.type case handling in the rootReducer to update the store. Remember not to mutate the state!

3. Adding Subscriptions

    Show how to add subscriptions to the store to get updated whenever an action is dispatched.
