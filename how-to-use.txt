How to use the downloaded files

1) Run "npm install" in the extracted folder
2) Run "npm start" to view the project

Compare my code to yours to solve issues you might encounter. You may also copy the content of src/ into your own project's src/ folder to use your project setup (which might've been created with a different create-react-app version) and still use my code.

1. Setting Up the Reducer and Store

    Show users the stand-alone function of redux by create a node.js file containing a store and reducer and output the state.
    npm install --save redux

    const redux = require("redux");
    const createStore = redux.createStore;

    initialState = {
        counter: 0
    };

    // Reducer
    rootReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
        if (action.type == "INC_COUNTER") {
            return {
            ...state,
            counter: state.counter + 1
            };
        }
        if (action.type == "ADD_COUNTER") {
            return {
            ...state,
            counter: state.counter + action.value
            };
        }

        return state;
    };

    // Store
    const store = createStore(rootReducer);
    console.log(store.getState());

2. Dispacting Actions

    Create 2 store.dispatch to show users how to dispatch an action. Create action.type case handling in the rootReducer to update the store. Remember not to mutate the state!

    // Dispatching Action
    store.dispatch({ type: "INC_COUNTER" });
    store.dispatch({ type: "ADD_COUNTER", value: 10 });
    console.log(store.getState());

3. Adding Subscriptions

    Show how to add subscriptions to the store to get updated whenever an action is dispatched.

    // Subscription
    store.subscribe(() => {
        console.log("[Subscription]", store.getState());
    });

4. Connecting React to Redux

    The store should be created right before the application starts (index.js).
    Create a store folder and reducer file that returns the state. Create a store in index.js.

    ----------index.js---------------
    import { createStore } from "redux";

    import reducer from "./store/reducer";

    const store = createStore(reducer);

    ------------reducer.js-----------------
    const initialState = {
        counter: 0
    };

    const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
        if (action.type === "INCREMENT") {
            return state;
        }
        return state;
    };

    export default reducer;

5. Connecting the Store to React

    npm install --save react-redux
    import Provider. Allows us to inject store into React components.

    ---------index.js---------------
    import { Provider } from "react-redux";

    ReactDOM.render(
        <Provider store={store}>
            <App />
        </Provider>,
        document.getElementById("root")
    );

    How to get the counter value from the store into the Counter container? (What is a container?)
    We don't change the pattern of a few selected components getting the state and passing it on.
    
    -----------Counter.js-------------    
    import { connect } from 'react-redux' to connect container to store. connect is a curried function.

    const mapReduxStateToContainerProps = state => {
        return {
            ctr: state.counter
        };
    };

    export default connect(
        mapReduxStateToContainerProps,
    )(Counter);


    connect takes a function: mapReduxStateToContainerProps. 
    The state in the container manages internal state.
    Update react and react-dom to 16.6.0 and type npm update


6. Dispatching Actions from within the Container

    Connect takes another argument: mapDispatchActionsToContainerProps
    This function returns an object with onIncrementCounter.
    Update CounterControl in Counter.js to use this.props.onIncrementCounter.
              clicked={this.props.onIncrementCounter}


    This function will be available through the props.
    const mapDispatchActionsToContainerProps = dispatch => {
        return {
            onIncrementCounter: () => dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT" }),
        };
    };

    Update reducer with if statement to handle 'INCREMENT' case

    const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
        if (action.type === "INCREMENT") {
            return {
                counter: state.counter + 1
            };
        }
        return state;
    };

7. Assignment: Passing and Retrieving Data with Action

    Give 5 minutes to fill out the rest of the actions.

8. Switch-Case in the Reducer

    Change out the if statements for switch cases

    -------reducer.js-----------
    const initialState = {
        counter: 0,
        results: []
    };

    const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
        case "INCREMENT":
        return {
            ...state,
            counter: state.counter + 1
        };
        case "DECREMENT":
        return {
            ...state,
            counter: state.counter - 1
        };
        case "ADD":
        return {
            ...state,
            counter: state.counter + action.value
        };
        case "SUBTRACT":
        return {
            ...state,
            counter: state.counter - action.value
        };
        default:
        return state;
    }
    };

    export default reducer;
