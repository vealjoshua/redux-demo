How to use the downloaded files

1) Run "npm install" in the extracted folder
2) Run "npm start" to view the project

Compare my code to yours to solve issues you might encounter. You may also copy the content of src/ into your own project's src/ folder to use your project setup (which might've been created with a different create-react-app version) and still use my code.

1. Setting Up the Reducer and Store

    Show users the stand-alone function of redux by create a node.js file containing a store and reducer and output the state.
    npm install --save redux

    const redux = require("redux");
    const createStore = redux.createStore;

    initialState = {
        counter: 0
    };

    // Reducer
    rootReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
        if (action.type == "INC_COUNTER") {
            return {
            ...state,
            counter: state.counter + 1
            };
        }
        if (action.type == "ADD_COUNTER") {
            return {
            ...state,
            counter: state.counter + action.value
            };
        }

        return state;
    };

    // Store
    const store = createStore(rootReducer);
    console.log(store.getState());

2. Dispacting Actions

    Create 2 store.dispatch to show users how to dispatch an action. Create action.type case handling in the rootReducer to update the store. Remember not to mutate the state!

    // Dispatching Action
    store.dispatch({ type: "INC_COUNTER" });
    store.dispatch({ type: "ADD_COUNTER", value: 10 });
    console.log(store.getState());

3. Adding Subscriptions

    Show how to add subscriptions to the store to get updated whenever an action is dispatched.

    // Subscription
    store.subscribe(() => {
        console.log("[Subscription]", store.getState());
    });

4. Connecting React to Redux

    The store should be created right before the application starts (index.js).
    Create a store folder and reducer file that returns the state. Create a store in index.js.

    ----------index.js---------------
    import { createStore } from "redux";

    import reducer from "./store/reducer";

    const store = createStore(reducer);

    ------------reducer.js-----------------
    const initialState = {
        counter: 0
    };

    const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
        if (action.type === "INCREMENT") {
            return state;
        }
        return state;
    };

    export default reducer;

5. Connecting the Store to React

    npm install --save react-redux
    import Provider. Allows us to inject store into React components.

    ---------index.js---------------
    import { Provider } from "react-redux";

    ReactDOM.render(
        <Provider store={store}>
            <App />
        </Provider>,
        document.getElementById("root")
    );

    How to get the counter value from the store into the Counter container? (What is a container?)
    We don't change the pattern of a few selected components getting the state and passing it on.
    
    -----------Counter.js-------------    
    import { connect } from 'react-redux' to connect container to store. connect is a curried function.

    const mapReduxStateToContainerProps = state => {
        return {
            ctr: state.counter
        };
    };

    export default connect(
        mapReduxStateToContainerProps,
    )(Counter);


    connect takes a function: mapReduxStateToContainerProps. 
    The state in the container manages internal state.
    Update react and react-dom to 16.6.0 and type npm update


6. Dispatching Actions from within the Container

    Connect takes another argument: mapDispatchActionsToContainerProps
    This function returns an object with onIncrementCounter.
    Update CounterControl in Counter.js to use this.props.onIncrementCounter.
              clicked={this.props.onIncrementCounter}


    This function will be available through the props.
    const mapDispatchActionsToContainerProps = dispatch => {
        return {
            onIncrementCounter: () => dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT" }),
        };
    };

    Update reducer with if statement to handle 'INCREMENT' case

    const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
        if (action.type === "INCREMENT") {
            return {
                counter: state.counter + 1
            };
        }
        return state;
    };

7. Assignment: Passing and Retrieving Data with Action

    Give 5 minutes to fill out the rest of the actions.

8. Switch-Case in the Reducer

    Change out the if statements for switch cases

    -------reducer.js-----------
    const initialState = {
        counter: 0,
        results: []
    };

    const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
        case "INCREMENT":
        return {
            ...state,
            counter: state.counter + 1
        };
        case "DECREMENT":
        return {
            ...state,
            counter: state.counter - 1
        };
        case "ADD":
        return {
            ...state,
            counter: state.counter + action.value
        };
        case "SUBTRACT":
        return {
            ...state,
            counter: state.counter - action.value
        };
        default:
        return state;
    }
    };

    export default reducer;


9. Updating State Immutably

    We are going to create a way to store the counter and delete it.

    Add results to initialState.

    --------reducer.js---------
    const initialState = {
        counter: 0,
        results: []
    };

    ------Counter.js----------
    Add onStoreResult and onDeleteResult to mapDispatchToProps.
    
    onStoreResult: () => dispatch({ type: "STORE_RESULT" }),
    onDeleteResult: id => dispatch({ type: "DELETE_RESULT", resultElId: id })

    Add the onClick props to the button and li.

        <hr />
        <button onClick={this.props.onStoreResult}>Store Result</button>
        <ul>
            <li onClick={this.props.onDeleteResult}></li>
        </ul>
    
    The actions have to be handled in the reducer.
    Add spread operator to each case. 
    On storeResult, create a new resuls array with state.results.concat(state.counter)

    -----------reducer.js------------
    case "STORE_RESULT":
      return {
        ...state,
        results: state.results.concat({ id: new Date(), value: state.counter })
      };
    case "DELETE_RESULT":
      return {};

    Add storedResult to the container props. 
    
    const mapReduxStateToContainerProps = state => {
        return {
            ctr: state.counter,
            storedResults: state.results
        };
    };


    map out storedResult to li elements.

    <hr />
        <button onClick={this.props.onStoreResult}>Store Result</button>
        <ul>
          {this.props.storedResults.map(strResult => (
            <li
              key={strResult.id}
              onClick={() => this.props.onDeleteResult(strResult.id)}
            >
              {strResult.value}
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>

11. Outsourcing Action Types

    It's a good practice to outsource actions to reduce bugs typos.
    Create an actions.js file in the store and export const actions.

    export const INCREMENT = "INCREMENT";
    export const DECREMENT = "DECREMENT";
    export const ADD = "ADD";
    export const SUBTRACT = "SUBTRACT";
    export const STORE_RESULT = "STORE_RESULT";
    export const DELETE_RESULT = "DELETE_RESULT";

    import * as actionTypes from './actions' in reducer.js and Counter.js
    If a case is mispelled, the compiler throws an error.
    Replace actionTypes in reducer and Counter

12. Combining Multiple Reducers

    Split up the reducers in reducer.js. This will help the code scale as more code is added.
    Create a reducers folder. Create 2 files counter, result (the 2 states) in the reducers folder.
    Copy reducer code to both files. Update the actions import. The counter is still being access in result.js because the reducers are going to be combined in the end.
    Delete reducer.js
    Import the reducers into index.js
    Import  from 'redux'
    Combine the reducers.
    const rootReducer = combineReducers({
        ctr: counterReducer,
        res: resultReducer
    })
    Update mapReduxStateToContainerProps with state.ctr.counter, state.res.result. Combining reducers adds another layer.
    There's an error now. The reducer function only has access to the local state, not the global state.
    Update result.js with action.result instead of state.counter
    Update Counter.js by passing result into dispatch, sending the result in the payload, and passing the counter in the button onClick.
    Changed the list key to index. Deleted Counter.js CounterChangedHandler and state.
